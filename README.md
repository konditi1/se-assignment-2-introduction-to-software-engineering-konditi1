```
##### Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Phases and Workflow

| Phase       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Concept     | Determines project scope, prioritizes projects, discusses requirements with clients, prepares documentation, estimates time and cost, and analyzes feasibility before commencing work.                                                                                   |
| Inception   | Builds development team, checks availability, selects team members, provides necessary tools and resources, starts design process, creates mock-ups of user interfaces, develops project architecture, refines requirements, determines product functionality, ensures all requirements are incorporated with regular check-ins. |
| Iteration   | Also known as construction, involves bulk of the work. Developers work with UX designers to turn designs into code, build bare functionality, incorporate customer feedback, add features and tweaks in subsequent iterations, and use Agile methodologies for continuous improvements.                                         |
| Release     | Marks software's readiness for release. Quality assurance team performs tests to ensure functionality, developers address detected bugs or defects swiftly, user training occurs, final iteration is released into production, product is fully deployed and made available to customers.                                     |
| Maintenance | Software is fully deployed, support begins to keep system running smoothly, resolve new bugs, offer additional user training, and ensure users know how to use the product. New iterations may occur over time to refresh the product with upgrades and additional features.                                                         |
| Retirement  | Software enters this phase due to replacement with new software or becoming obsolete or incompatible. Users are notified of retirement, migrated to replacement system if available, and remaining end-of-life activities are carried out by the development team, including removing support for the existing software.     |


#### Waterfall Project Management:
